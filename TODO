Ruler:
- With some weird dimensions, the horizontal ruler does not register and it leaves part of it blank
- There is no dynamic growth and shrinking, so with low zoom, everything is compressed and with high zoom, everything is spread appart
- Add tick options to document menu in the controller

OffsetScale:
- Rotation not accounted for (perhaps abstract canvas occupancy coordinates to context?)
- Zoom also not accounted for

For the future:
- DISABLE HOTKEYS!
