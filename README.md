# Tordie 6 Source Code

## Introduction

Tordie is a powerful SVG generator with mathematical operations for use in Origami and scoring. This version has since been deprecated with plans for a web version in the near future.

After five versions of being a convoluted Python script/module hybrid, it is finally being converted into a user-friendly app. The version that was presented at OSME was V5, with source code still available [here](https://github.com/Moaesaycto/Tordie5).

This project is primary maintained by me, [Moae](https://moaesaycto.github.io/). If you like what I do, consider checking out some of my [other projects](https://moaesaycto.github.io/#/projects).

## Setting Up

Firstly, you will need to install the following prerequisites to compile this code:
- [Rust + Cargo](https://rustup.rs)
- [Node.js + npm](https://nodejs.org)
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) (Add this to your system Path variable)
- [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org)
- Tauri CLI: `cargo install tauri-cli`


Once installed, you can verify everything is working with:

```bash
cargo --version
npm --version
inkscape --version
magick -version
```
In the project root, be sure to run

```bash
npm install
```

## Preparing the Icons
The file `src-tauri` contains a file called `icon.bat`. This will automatically call `npx tauri icon <path>` and generate the respective icons for the different operating systems. Run the batch file from within `src-tauri`.

If you are not using Windows, you may need to handle this manually. The SVG data for the icons is in `src-tauri/svg`.

Additionally, there are some BMP files for use in the NSIS installer. These are not so important.

More information will be added to this section as development progresses.

## Running the App (Development Mode)
To run the code, you can run

```bash
npx run tauri dev
```

## Building the App
To build the app, be sure to compile the icons first as described above. Then, simply run:

```bash
npx run tauri build
```

If you are looking to lower the memory load, you can restrict the number of jobs by using the following:

```bash
npx run tauri build -- --jobs 2
```
